# ETL Data Pipeline using Spotify API

To build a simple data pipeline (or in other words, a data feed) that downloads Spotify data
on what songs we've listened to in the last 24 hours, and saves that data in a SQLite database.

We will schedule this pipeline to run daily. After a few months we will end up with our own, private Spotify played tracks history dataset!
